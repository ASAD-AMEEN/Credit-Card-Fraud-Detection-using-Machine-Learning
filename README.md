# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Description:
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of credit transaction data, covering the following key steps:

Data Upload: The repository provides the dataset used for analysis. This dataset includes information related to credit transactions.

Data Preprocessing:

Missing Values: The data was checked for missing values, and appropriate handling or imputation strategies were applied to address any missing data points.
Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.
Feature Selection: To determine the optimal features for a neural network classification model, a correlation analysis was performed. Features that demonstrated significant correlation with the target variable were chosen for further analysis.

Class Imbalance: Class imbalance in the target variable was assessed. This was visualized through plots and charts to understand the distribution of classes.

Model Training: A neural network classification model was developed to predict the target variable. The model was trained using the selected features and a suitable architecture for classification tasks.

Model Testing: The trained neural network model was evaluated using a test set of data to assess its performance and predictive accuracy.
